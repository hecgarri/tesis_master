These are the distribution programs for the paper

"Testing for Threshold Cointegration in Vector Error Correction Models" 
by Bruce E. Hansen and Byeongseon Seo.

The files consist of

readme.R		this file
tar_ci.R		R program file
tar_rate.R		R program file
ur_rate.R		R program file (univarite tests)
tar.R		      R procedure file (univariate TAR tests)
zeroyld.dat		ASCII data file

The program tar_rate.R is set up to replicate the empirical work reported in our paper.
The program tar_ci.R is intended for modification for other empirical applications.

The procedure tar.R executes the univariate TAR tests in Hansen (1996, Econometrica).

The dataset zeroyld.dat was taken from the wepage of Huston McCulloch:

NOTE:

There was an error in the original computer program used for the paper, 
which loaded the data incorrectly.
Thus the results as reported in the paper are somewhat incorrect.
This error has been corrected in the included files.
